                            The Bumble Smart Profile Assistant helps users
                            improve their profiles by analyzing interactions such as right and left
                            swipes and dwell time on images and other profile elements. It also tracks
                            location-based trends to provide personalized recommendations. By balancing
                            data-driven insights with user individuality, it offers actionable guidance
                            to help users make their profiles more engaging while preserving their
                            individuality. Prototypes were created using Figma and the Atlassian Design
                            System.

                    <h3 class="project-subheading"> Challenges</h3>
                    <p>
                        Create a cross-platform digital service for Bumble, taking into consideration a
                        design brief, functional spec, and data analytics.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="project-subheading"> Approach</h3>
                    <p class="bold">Design Brief + Spec</p>
                    <p>The project began by examining the design brief and analytics to better
                        understand the underlying goals and challenges. It heavily focused on
                        encouraging users to allow access to precise-location services</p>

                    <p class="bold">Problem Reframing</p>
                    <p>Initially, I questioned the necessity of location services as a primary tool
                        for increasing subscribers and gaining user insight, believing more
                        privacy-respectful solutions were possible. Research, including user polls,
                        revealed that location services primarily benefit Bumble rather than users,
                        and many users are uncomfortable with them.</p>

                    <p class="bold">Qualitative Research</p>
                    <p>To enhance the depth of my research, I explored platforms like Reddit, which
                        allowed me to gather valuable anecdotal insights. I observed that users
                        regularly seek opinions on their profiles from both in-person and digital
                        communities. This behavior underscores the importance of providing guidance
                        based on feedback, emphasizing the need for features that facilitate user
                        validation and support.</p>

                    <p class="bold">Concept Development</p>
                    <p>Profile Assistant: The assistant was designed to provide clear value to users
                        by offering personalized feedback and suggestions, addressing the same needs
                        that ultimately create value for Bumble.</p>

                    <h3 class="project-subheading"> Wireframes: First Iteration</h3>
                    <p>
                        To develop the Smart Profile Assistant, I began with low-fidelity wireframes
                        that aligned closely with Bumbleâ€™s existing profile editing screens. The goal
                        was to integrate the assistant seamlessly without disrupting the familiar user
                        experience. The initial wireframe emphasizes assistant suggestions, making them
                        visible and data-forward.
                    </p>
                    <img src="assets/bumble/wireframe-1.png" class="process-image">

                    <h3 class="project-subheading"> Wireframes: Second Iteration</h3>
                    <p> <span class="bold">Critical Decision</span>: Lowering the assistant down a layer in the hierarchy.</p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">Rationale</span>: Initially, the assistant was highly visible, but early feedback
                        indicated that users preferred control over how they engaged with suggestions.
                        By making the assistant an optional feature rather than front-loading it or
                        making it highly visible, users can engage with it on their own terms. This
                        approach respects users' familiarity with the existing system and avoids
                        overwhelming them with new functionality. The assistant is designed to be
                        non-intrusive, quietly accessible, and supportive, offering smart suggestions
                        when called upon, ensuring it enhances the user experience without disrupting or
                        dictating it.

                    <h3 class="project-subheading"> Initial Prototype</h3>
                    <p>
                        Early prototypes emphasized data transparency, but user testing revealed
                        challenges in interpreting the insights. Some users found the data overwhelming
                        or struggled to act on the information provided.
                    </p>

                    <p class="list-start">Key Testing Insights:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users appreciated the descriptive feedback and the bee assistant's personality.</li>
                        <li>The raw data was difficult to interpret.</li>
                        <li>Users preferred suggestions framed in a conversational, supportive way.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="list-start">How This Informed Design Changes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Shifted from displaying direct engagement metrics to warm, qualitative feedback.</li>
                        <li>Reduced the visibility of numbers and statistics in favor of contextualized, easy-to-understand suggestions.</li>
                        <li>Maintained a balance between personalized insights and user autonomy.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="project-subheading"> Finalizing Prototype</h3>
                    <p> <span class="bold">Critical Decision</span>: Warm, Qualitative Feedback and Reduced Quantitative Feedback</p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">Rationale</span>: Users saw their profiles as personal
                        extensions of themselves, and a friendly, human (bee)-like assistant created a
                        more welcoming experience. Testing confirmed that users felt more comfortable
                        with abstracted, qualitative suggestions rather than data-heavy feedback. This
                        shift reinforced trust and made the assistant feel more like a helpful guide
                        rather than a judgmental evaluator.

                    <h3 class="project-subheading">Key Takeaways</h3>
                    <p class="bold">Importance of User Testing</p>
                    <p>
                        The moments when I gained the most valuable insights were during conversations
                        with test users and through surveys. These interactions were essential in
                        clarifying the direction of my project. However, I recognize that I could have
                        bettered my process by conducting additional tests on my prototypes and
                        diversifying the range of participants I engaged with. This project would have
                        benefitted a lot from a broader approach.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bold">Balancing Familiarity & Innovation</p>
                    <p>
                        While I am naturally drawn to unconventional design approaches, this project
                        reinforced the importance of leveraging established conventions for clarity and
                        usability. Moving forward, I aim to find the right balance between creative
                        exploration and intuitive, user-friendly experiences.
